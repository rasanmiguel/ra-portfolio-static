        <h2>Aspiring Fullstack Developer</h2>

        <p>I am a fullstack developer with an interest in cloud technology. I started my tech career
            learning Python
            since
            it is widely used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which was a big focus of my undergraduate degree.
            Somehow, I ended up being interested in web development and picked up JavaScript along the way.</p>

        <p>I plan to revisit GIS someday and hopefully mix it with my newfound Python and JavaScript skillset to create
            fun
            projects, but for now, my focus is on fullstack development and the cloud.</p>

        <p>As a developer, I primarily use the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack on my projects.</p>
